exercise 1 normal equation is not correct - your x_average and y_average are not scalars but vectors. Thus, your 'B' value is a bit off and the 'a' value is a vector. -0.5 points

Exercise 2 is nice, you were supposed to use tf-idf features, but used CountVectorizer, which only gives you token counts, not tf-idf scores, but we accept it.
